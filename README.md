<h1>TrainYourOwnCNN</h1>
This is a python script, that allows any person, with no programming experience to train a CNN, just by showing an object in front of the camera.

<h2>This script is free and easy to use. Just install all the necessary modules, and execute it. You will be prompted to train two objects. Just click one one, and hold an object in front of the camera until its done training. </h2>
